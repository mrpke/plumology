Plumology
=========

Plumology is a python library of tools and utilities to analyse the output from biased molecular dynamics simulations.

Plumology allows the analysis of biased molecular dynamics data, in particular output from PLUMED. It features:
- Reading plumed output files
- Creating weighted probability distributions, WHAM
- An implementation of a self-organising-map
- Efficient storage and retrieval of data via HDF5
- Wrappers for common backcalculation of experimental values
- Convergence analysis for Metadynamics
- Comparing data from different simulations
- Calculating experimental data RMSDs
- A diverse set of flexible plotting routines

Install
-------

Run `pip install ./` in the module directory.
